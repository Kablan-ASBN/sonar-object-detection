# Sonar Object Detection with Transfer Learning and Domain Adaptation

This repository contains the complete implementation of my MSc dissertation project:

**“Object Detection in Sidescan Sonar Data Using Transfer Learning and Domain Adaptation to Reduce the Need for Manual Annotation”**

The project explores how domain adaptation techniques can improve the generalization of deep learning models on noisy sidescan sonar imagery, especially when labeled data is limited. It introduces a complete training and evaluation framework using Faster R-CNN, transfer learning, and adversarial domain adaptation strategies. All experiments were conducted on real-world sonar images provided by Seabed.ai.

> All final 20-epoch models and domain adaptation experiments were trained using mixed-precision (AMP) in Google Colab Pro on an NVIDIA A100 GPU. Exploratory 5-epoch models were trained without AMP.

## Dataset

The sonar dataset was provided by Seabed.ai in YOLO format, originally containing **3,464 label files**, one per image. Each file encoded bounding box annotations for either **object** or **object_1** classes.

### Annotation Semantics

Following visual inspection and domain-specific reasoning:

- The label **object** was retained.
- The label **object_1** was renamed to **shadow**, based on its appearance as an acoustic projection cast by solid objects on the seafloor.

This renaming clarified the distinction between physical structures and their sonar-induced shadows. The **background class** (class ID 0) was left **implicit**, as required by the Faster R-CNN implementation.

---

### Conversion to Pascal VOC Format

To enable compatibility with standard object detection pipelines, all YOLO-format labels were converted to **Pascal VOC format** using a custom multithreaded conversion notebook (`convert_yolo_to_voc.ipynb`). This script performed:

- Transformation of normalized YOLO boxes into absolute Pascal VOC coordinates
- Filtering of empty `.txt` files with no valid object annotations
- Creation of `.xml` files in `Annotations/` for all valid samples
- Copying and format-standardization of corresponding `.jpg` images to `JPEGImages/`
- Generation of stratified `train.txt`, `val.txt`, and `test.txt` splits under `ImageSets/Main/`

**Final Conversion Summary:**

| Metric                      | Value     |
|----------------------------|-----------|
| Original label files       | 3,464     |
| Valid converted annotations| 1,788     |
| Skipped (empty labels)     | 1,676     |
| Skipped (no image found)   | 0         |
| Skipped (invalid class ID) | 0         |

> YOLO annotations with no bounding boxes were automatically excluded. This ensured that every sample in the final dataset provided useful training signal and met the structural expectations of the VOC format.

---

### Preprocessed Dataset Variants

The converted dataset was further processed to create additional variants for experimentation:

- `line2yolo/`: Original dataset with YOLO-format annotations
- `line2voc/`: Cleaned Pascal VOC version with semantic label remapping
- `line2voc_preprocessed/`: Median-blurred version for speckle noise reduction
- `line2voc_preprocessed_augmented/`: CLAHE-enhanced with additional geometric augmentations (flip, rotate, jitter)

> Note: The augmented dataset introduced alignment errors due to spatial transformations that were not applied to the original bounding boxes, negatively affecting model performance.

---

### Dataset Splits

To ensure balanced evaluation and reproducibility, the final dataset was **stratified** by object composition (`only_shadow`, `only_object`, `both`) and split into:

- `train.txt`: 80%
- `val.txt`: 10%
- `test.txt`: 10%

These splits were used consistently across all training and evaluation pipelines, including baseline and domain adaptation models.

---

## Model Architecture

This project implements object detection using **Faster R-CNN** with a **ResNet-50 FPN** backbone. The architecture was selected for its robustness in handling small-scale features and its strong performance in a wide range of object detection tasks.

The model predicts three classes:
- **0** — Background (implicit)
- **1** — Shadow
- **2** — Object

---

### Base Model: Faster R-CNN with ResNet-50 FPN

The detector is initialized with pretrained weights from the **COCO dataset** (*Common Objects in Context*), which contains over 200,000 images across 80 categories. Leveraging COCO weights provides strong low-level visual priors for transfer learning, allowing the model to converge quickly on the sonar dataset.

I used the built-in `fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn` from `torchvision.models.detection`, modifying the classification head to support 3 target classes.

Key architectural components:
- **Feature Pyramid Network (FPN)** for multi-scale detection
- **Region Proposal Network (RPN)** for generating candidate object regions
- **Two-stage head** for classification and bounding box regression
- **Losses:** Cross-entropy (classification) and Smooth L1 (localization)

---

### Custom VOC Loader: `voc_dataset.py`

To handle training with the converted Pascal VOC dataset, I developed a custom dataset loader, `voc_dataset.py`, which:

- Parses `.xml` annotation files into PyTorch-compatible targets
- Loads corresponding `.jpg` images from the `JPEGImages/` folder
- Returns `(image, target)` pairs in the format expected by Faster R-CNN
- Includes a custom collate function for proper batching in DataLoader

This script enabled clean and reproducible integration of sonar annotations into the deep learning training loop.

### Trained Model Variants

| Model Name                     | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Baseline (Raw)**            | Trained on unprocessed sonar images                                        |
| **Baseline (Denoised)**       | Trained on median-filtered images to reduce speckle noise                  |
| **Baseline (CLAHE + Aug)**    | Trained on images enhanced with CLAHE and offline augmentations (flip, rotate, jitter) |
| **DANN**                      | Domain-Adversarial Neural Network using a gradient reversal layer and a domain classifier |
| **DCCAN**                     | My hybrid domain adaptation model combining DANN and CDAN losses with adaptive weighting |

---

### DCCAN: A Novel Hybrid Domain Adaptation Model

As part of this dissertation, I developed **DCCAN** (*Domain-Conditional Combined Adversarial Network*), a hybrid model that integrates:

- **DANN loss**: Global feature alignment using a domain classifier with a Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL)
- **CDAN loss**: Class-conditional alignment using the outer product of features and softmax logits

To stabilize and balance these contributions, I introduced two **learnable loss weights**, `λ₁` and `λ₂`, which are passed through a `softplus()` activation and regularized with an L2 penalty:

Total_Loss = Detection_Loss + λ₁·DANN_Loss + λ₂·CDAN_Loss + α·(λ₁² + λ₂²)

This formulation supports mixed precision training (AMP), stable convergence, and improved generalization across noisy sonar domains. DCCAN was implemented using the THUML Transfer Learning Library as a foundation, and refined to support modern PyTorch workflows.

> I propose DCCAN as a novel hybrid approach for domain adaptation in sonar object detection tasks under significant visual domain shift.

## Training Configuration

All models were trained in **Google Colab Pro** using an **NVIDIA A100 GPU (40 GB VRAM)**. Mixed-precision training (`torch.cuda.amp`) was enabled for all **20-epoch** models to accelerate training and reduce memory usage. Early exploratory models (5 epochs) were trained without AMP.

Training pipelines are implemented using **PyTorch** and the `torchvision` detection API, with custom modifications for domain adaptation models (DANN, DCCAN). Model checkpoints, loss logs, and evaluation outputs are saved to Google Drive.

---

### Logging and Evaluation

During training, I recorded:

- Epoch-level total loss, domain losses, and adaptive weight curves (DCCAN)
- Model evaluation metrics after each epoch using TorchMetrics (mAP@0.50, mAR@100)
- Wall time and memory footprint (AMP helped fit full-size batches)
- Detection count statistics and per-class recall on the validation and test splits

Final performance was always measured on the **target domain** (raw sonar), including both quantitative metrics and visual inspection of predicted bounding boxes.

---

## Model Checkpoints

This section provides access to all trained model weights used in this project. Checkpoints are stored in `.pth` format and were saved after each training run on Google Colab Pro using an NVIDIA A100 GPU.

All 20-epoch models were trained with mixed-precision (AMP). Exploratory 5-epoch models were trained without AMP for rapid prototyping and validation.

---

### Baseline Models — Faster R-CNN (ResNet-50 FPN)

All baseline models use the `fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn` architecture from `torchvision`, initialized with COCO-pretrained weights. Models were fine-tuned on different versions of the sidescan sonar dataset.

#### 5-Epoch Baselines (Exploratory Phase)

These models were trained to test preprocessing effects and familiarize with Faster R-CNN. They are **not used** in final comparisons.

## Evaluation and Results

This section presents a comprehensive evaluation of all object detection models developed during the project. Each model was assessed on the **raw target domain** using consistent validation and test splits. Evaluation was conducted using the `torchmetrics.detection.MeanAveragePrecision` module, which provides per-class and overall detection metrics.

All evaluations were performed in inference mode using **mixed-precision (AMP)** on an **NVIDIA A100 GPU** in **Google Colab Pro**. No test-time augmentation was applied. The evaluation setup mirrors the actual deployment conditions: **Pascal VOC format**, raw sonar input, fixed model weights (no fine-tuning), and consistent detection thresholds.

---

### Key Evaluation Metrics

- **mAP@0.5**: Mean Average Precision at IoU threshold 0.5  
- **mAR@100**: Mean Average Recall at 100 detections  
- **Per-class recall** for both `object` and `shadow` categories  
- **Total number of detections per model**  
- **Detection distribution per image** (mean and median)

---

### Final Test Set Results — Raw Target Domain

| Baseline (Raw, 20 Epochs)        | 0.1621  | 0.1387  | 34,323           | —              | —              |
| Baseline (Denoised, 20 Epochs)   | 0.1776  | 0.1517  | 32,145           | —              | —              |
| Baseline (CLAHE+Aug, 20 Epochs)  | 0.0196  | 0.0410  | 39,192           | —              | —              |
| DANN (20 Epochs)                 | 0.1122  | 0.1175  | 3,220            | 0.0791         | 0.1560         |
| DCCAN (20 Epochs)                | 0.1513  | 0.1457  | 12,713           | 0.1085         | 0.1830         |

- **Denoised baseline** achieved the highest mAP@0.5.
- **DCCAN** provided the best domain-adaptive generalization, outperforming DANN in recall and detection volume.
- **CLAHE+Augmented** baseline suffered from over-detection, resulting in a high false positive rate and lowest mAP.

|------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Total Detections             | 34,323     | 32,145     | 39,192     | 3,220       | 12,713      |

- **DANN** produced the fewest predictions, consistent with its conservative domain discriminator.
- **DCCAN** maintained higher per-class recall while avoiding over-detection.
- **CLAHE+Aug** variant consistently overpredicted, skewing precision-recall balance.

## Conclusion

This project presents a complete and reproducible pipeline for object detection in sidescan sonar imagery using transfer learning and adversarial domain adaptation. Through the development of multiple Faster R-CNN baselines and the novel DCCAN framework, the research demonstrates how detection models can generalize across challenging underwater domains, even in the presence of domain shift and limited annotated data.

Key contributions include:

- A structured dataset pipeline, including YOLO-to-VOC conversion, class remapping, and stratified data splitting  
- Baseline models trained on raw, denoised, and CLAHE-augmented sonar imagery  
- Implementation of DANN (Domain-Adversarial Neural Network) for unsupervised adaptation  
- Development of **DCCAN** (Domain-Conditional Combined Adversarial Network), a hybrid model that balances global and class-conditional alignment using learnable adaptive weights  
- Rigorous evaluation using `torchmetrics`, including mAP, mAR, and per-class recall on the raw sonar test domain  

Results confirm that domain adaptation significantly improves cross-domain generalization, with DCCAN outperforming all baselines and the DANN model across key performance metrics.
